<a name="notes-regarding-the-translation" class="anchor" href="#notes-regarding-the-translation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Notes Regarding the Translation</h2>

<p>The first nine chapters are translated now.  There are two further chapters,
whose implementation requires polymorphic recursion.  This feature was not
available in OCaml for a while, which is why they have not been translated yet.
Feel free to contribute them!</p>

<p>This translation is as close as possible to the original code, but some
deviations from the original were necessary.  The following rules / differences
to the original sources exist:</p>

<h3>
<a name="no-base-module" class="anchor" href="#no-base-module"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>No base module</h3>

<p>Since there is hardly anything indispensable in the base module, its relevant
contents was copied into each module.  This allows for easier testing,
because the modules do not depend on others.</p>

<h3>
<a name="syntax" class="anchor" href="#syntax"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Syntax</h3>

<p>Names are created by the following rules:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Module types are written in capitals.  If they consist of more than a
word, an underscore (<code>_</code>) is placed between the words.</p></li>
<li><p>Names of exceptions follow the same rule as modules types.</p></li>
<li><p>Module implementations have to start with a capital letter, the rest of
the name is lowercase - except if it consists of more than one word.
In this case the first letter of the following word is uppercase.
There is no underscore between words.</p></li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="currying-of-function-parameters" class="anchor" href="#currying-of-function-parameters"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Currying of function parameters</h3>

<p>Currying is not used anywhere in the original source.  The translation
curries parameters where it makes sense.  Tuples that represent a named type
(e.g. some data structure) are <em>not</em> curried in functions that are hidden by
a signature restriction.  This seems to aid comprehension.  Functions offered
via the module interface (signature) do not reveal such implementation details
(i.e. the concrete type) anyway.</p>

<h3>
<a name="superfluous-bindings" class="anchor" href="#superfluous-bindings"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Superfluous bindings</h3>

<p>If a parameter is never used in a following expression, it is not bound to
any name.  The underscore (<code>_</code>) will hold its place.</p>

<h3>
<a name="lazy-evaluation" class="anchor" href="#lazy-evaluation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Lazy evaluation</h3>

<p>The syntax for lazy evaluation used to implement the data structures
and algorithms that require them is quite different from the original.
The <code>lazy</code> type is used to specify data structures that need lazy evaluation.
OCaml recently also introduced pattern matching on lazy values, which is
used throughout.</p>

<p>To make the syntax at least a bit more similar to the original, we have
also introduced the prefix operator (<code>!$</code>), which stands for <code>force</code> -
it forces evaluation of a lazy expression.  To make an expression lazy,
the OCaml-keyword <code>lazy</code> is used.</p>

<p>There is a test function at the end of the translation of chapter 4, the
chapter in which lazy evaluation and streams (= lazy lists) are introduced.
Uncomment it to see how lazy evaluation works.</p>

<h2>
<a name="notes-on-efficiency" class="anchor" href="#notes-on-efficiency"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Notes on Efficiency</h2>

<p>Because the data structures are purely functional, they profit a lot from
garbage collector settings.  In case you find that some of them are not
efficient enough, you might want to raise the memory overhead parameter of
the garbage collector.  Performance is in general excellent.</p>
